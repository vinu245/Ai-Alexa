# AI Alexa Using Python

# Overview

This project implements an AI-powered voice assistant similar to Amazon Alexa using Python. It utilizes speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, and natural language processing to execute user commands, fetch information, and perform various tasks.

# Features

Voice command recognition

Text-to-speech response

Answering general knowledge questions

Opening applications and websites

Fetching weather updates

Performing basic arithmetic calculations

# Technologies Used

Python 3.x

SpeechRecognition (for voice input)

pyttsx3 (for text-to-speech)

Wikipedia API (for fetching general knowledge)

Wolfram Alpha API (for calculations and queries)

OpenWeatherMap API (for weather updates)

# Installation

Prerequisites

Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system.

# Install Dependencies

The AI assistant will process your command and respond accordingly.

# Configuration

API Keys

Some features require API keys:

Wolfram Alpha API: Register at Wolfram Alpha and get an API key.

OpenWeatherMap API: Register at OpenWeatherMap and get an API key.

# Store the API keys in a config.py file:

WOLFRAM_ALPHA_API_KEY = "your_wolfram_alpha_api_key"
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY = "your_openweather_api_key"

# Example Commands
